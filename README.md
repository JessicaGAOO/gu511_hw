# Georgetown University Math & Statistics 511 **EXERCISES**

these notebooks are the exercises for the GU511 course. each of them will be
released in the 24 hours following our Tuesday courses and (unless otherwise
stated) will be due by the EOD on the following Wednesday. the due date will be
listed at the top of the notebook.

the method of submission for each assignment and what exactly is "due" will
change from assignment to assignment, but will be spelled out in detail in a
table at the top of every assignment.

## obtaining homework files

you don't *need* to download the individual `jupyter notebook` files that make
up your homework assignment, but you are welcome to do so if you'd prefer. there
are a few ways to do that:

### use `git`**

simply `git clone https://github.com/rzl-ds/gu511_hw.git` one time and obtain
all future updates by calling `git pull`


### download a single file

you can download any single *raw* notebook file.

*note*: the page you land on when you click the `hw##.ipynb` link is an `html`
document displaying the rendered that notebook. `jupyter` will not know what to
do with these files! you need to click the `raw` button at the top of the page
to access the raw `.ipynb` file
